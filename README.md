# hayayushi-portal
A website that handles sales, staff lists, and staff salaries.
Can accurately calculate staff's stocks and payouts.

## Scopes
The main scope will be a job portal for Hayayushi. There will be accounts in the portal.

### Accounts
Of course, there will be a login and registration system.
  - Root | Will overlook the whole job portal. (Developers have access to this account and can't be removed)
  - Manager | Will be the admin of the portal and can manage the pricelist and staff.
  - Other staff ranks | Can put their total stocks they've cooked. And how many sales they have.

### Clock in and Clock out
Staff can easily clock in and clock out without logging in on Discord.

### Sale Handles
A list like how much ramen or how many items they will buy, will automatically go into the database and calculate how many sales they have.

### Staffs List
Managers can handle staff lists who can register to the job portal. Once the manager removes them from the staff lists they can't register
or their account will be deleted from the database alongside the sales and stocks they have.

### Staff Salaries
The job portal can accurately calculate staff payouts.

## Development Purposes
